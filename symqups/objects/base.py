        '_args' is used by SymPy and should not be overriden, or the method
        .atoms which is crucial in this package will not work correctly.
            
        This allows us to store custom_args as accessible attributes. We can
        also set what each custom argument is called in a given subclass, 
        by defining a property then returning the argument.
        
        Having empty .args means that every instance of this class is atomic.
        As such, we make it our design philosophy to keep the subclasses
        atomic, allowing us to use the .atoms method in the algortihms to access
        these objects.
